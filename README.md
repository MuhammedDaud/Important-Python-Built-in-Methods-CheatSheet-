# Python Built-in Methods Cheat Sheet

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive cheat sheet on Python's built-in methods, providing quick references for commonly used methods across different data types and modules. The sheet covers string, list, dictionary, set, file I/O methods, and much more, designed to assist Python developers with a ready reference for efficient coding.

## Contents
The cheat sheet includes:
1. **String Methods**: Operations like `split()`, `join()`, `replace()`, and case conversions.
2. **List Methods**: Methods for list manipulation, including `append()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, and `reverse()`.
3. **Dictionary Methods**: Common dictionary operations such as `get()`, `keys()`, `values()`, and `update()`.
4. **Set Methods**: Set operations like `add()`, `remove()`, `union()`, and `intersection()`.
5. **File I/O Methods**: Methods for file handling, such as `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()`.
6. **General Purpose Functions**: Functions like `len()`, `type()`, `print()`, and `sorted()`.
7. **Conversion Functions**: Conversion between types, e.g., `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `list()`, etc.
8. **Mathematical Functions**: Functions like `abs()`, `sum()`, `min()`, and `max()`.
9. **Functional Programming Tools**: Tools for functional programming, including `filter()`, `map()`, and `reduce()`.
10. **Class and Object Related Methods**: Methods for object manipulation such as `getattr()`, `setattr()`, and `isinstance()`.
